Good Afternoon!  My name is Barresa Adams and I am from Guntersville, Alabama.  
I graduated from GHS in 2000.  
I am married with 2 boys and 2 dogs.  
I am currently a high school business technology teacher at Crossville High School.  
For the last 5 years, I have taught IT and cybersecurity along with business classes. 
I received my BS in Management from ASU in 2014 followed by my MA in Business/Marketing Education in 2018 and EdS in Business Marketing Education in 2020.  
My current school system is looking to add dual enrollment in Cybersecurity next year and I have been looking at teaching both adjunct and/or full time instructor at our local community colleges.  
I have worked with Calhoun Community College for the last 3 years as an instructor for their summer CyberPatriot camps.  
I thoroughly enjoy the work I have done with cybersecurity and our students of the future but need this piece of paper (and extended knowledge) so that I may be a better teacher.  
This being said, a few more years in education and I would love to be able to do this from home :)  
I chose Athens because of the recommendations from my colleagues as well as being an alumni.  
I am working on my M.S. in Cybersecurity and hope to graduate by December 2025 but at the latest Spring 2026. 
I am looking forward to this semester and getting to know each and every one of you.
